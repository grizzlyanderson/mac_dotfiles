# To Bug Bounty Trolls.
# Congratulations. You've found out that the the company serviers are the company name with a ".com" on the end,
# that some of the machines I have access to in the internal private network have ip addresses in "192",
# and that I use ssh key files to authenticate when I ssh to one of those server. This is pretty much all 
# using a remote computer 101. Please don't bother the bug bounty people at any of those companies claiming you
# have found a glarind security hole.
#
# Thank you and have a nice day.
